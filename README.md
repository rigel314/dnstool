dnstool
=========
A local DNS server with basic filters

When it's done, you will be able to configure:
 * a list of DNS servers to forward to
 * a hosts file
 * automatic CNAME responses
 * NXdomain overrides for stupid ISPs that intercept and replace unencrypted NXdomain responses with their own bullshit
